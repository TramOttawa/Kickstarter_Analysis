# Kickstarting with Excel
The analysis will be conducted based on the Kickstarter campaign data collected from 2009 to 2017 of 21 countries.
## Overview of Project
This part will be updated tomorrow.
### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to provide Louis with the comparation between campaigns faired in relation to their launch dates and funding goals. Through kickstart data set provided, I will apply my knowledge in excel by using pivot tables and graphing to analyze the outcomes based on launch dates and funding goals.
